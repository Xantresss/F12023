        <h1>History</h1>
          <div class="text">
            <h3>Red Bull Racing</h3>
            <p>One of the most successful Formula 1 teams of the modern era, Red Bull’s roots are sometimes forgotten.Like many teams on the grid today, the Austrian team’s history can be traced back more than two decades, but theirs includes three different teams including two no longer competing.</p>
          <p>To fully understand Red Bull’s F1 journey, we have to rewind a full decade before the Austrian drinks company entered officially with their own team.</p>
          <h3>Sauber (1995-2004)</h3>
          <p>Sauber were embarking on their third year in Formula 1 in 1995 and began the season with a new look thanks to a title sponsorship deal with Red Bull. Having acquired a majority share (which remained until 2002), Red Bull’s iconic red and yellow ‘bull’ logo was emblazoned on the car to create a livery closely resembling the one still used by the Red Bull team today.</p>

          <p>Red Bull co-founder Dietrich Mateschitz signed a sizeable deal with Sauber, one which saw them stay with the Swiss outfit until the end of 2004 when they made the move to enter F1 outright as a team. During their early years in F1, the brand became a fixture on the grid, and their partnership with Sauber peaked in 2004 when a young Finn by the name of Kimi Räikkönen starred as the team clinched an impressive fourth in the constructors’ championship.</p>

          <p>But that’s only half the story, in between the Sauber sponsorship and their own entry in 2005, came the foundations of what would become the Red Bull team today, and it all started in Milton Keynes.</p>
          <h3>Stewart Grand Prix (1997-1999)</h3>
          <p>In 1996, Formula 1 legend and three-time World Champion Jackie Stewart announced plans, together with son Paul, to enter his own team for the 1997 season. Stewart Racing had been a successful team in their own right prior to F1 and had run several well-known drivers in junior series such as British F3, and the F1 support series, F3000.</p>

            <p>Between 1997 and 1999, the team competed in Formula 1 with support from British manufacturer Ford and operated out of the same Milton Keynes headquarters where Red Bull are based today.
            
            Stewart Grand Prix performed well during their debut season, but poor reliability hampered them throughout and Rubens Barrichello’s second-place finish in Monaco was their only points finish.</p>
            <h3>Jaguar Racing (2000-2004)</h3>
            <p>With plans to create a ‘British Ferrari’, Stewart Grand Prix were officially renamed Jaguar Racing for the first season of the new millennium. Acting as the spearhead of Ford’s plans to promote the Jaguar brand on a global scale, the F1 project began with increased investment and the headline capture of Ferrari’s Eddie Irvine who’d finished as runner-up the previous year.</p>

              <p>Jaguar spent five seasons competing in Formula 1 following their takeover of the Stewart team, but progress was slow and the board at parent company Ford eventually grew frustrated with the team’s lack of results.
              
              Their debut season saw Irvine and Herbert complete an all-British driver lineup, with the Englishman staying on following their rebrand from Stewart. Despite winning a race the previous year with Stewart, 2000, unfortunately, marked a disappointing final chapter in Herbert’s F1 career as he failed to score a point in the uncompetitive Jaguar R1.</p>
              
              <p>Four points and ninth place in the constructors’ championship was a dismal return from Jaguar’s maiden season, and things didn’t improve much the next year either as a series of management changes did little to improve their fortunes.
              
              By the end of 2002, Ford’s patience was growing thin, and the pressure began to increase on Jaguar to produce a return on their expensive investment. There was some progress in 2003 as the team achieved their highest points total (18) to date thanks to some consistent performances from new recruit Mark Webber, but that ultimately proved to be a false dawn.
              
              In September 2004, Ford put Jaguar up for sale citing escalating costs required to win in Formula 1, and it wasn’t long before they were snapped up.</p>
              <h3>Red Bull Racing (2005-present)</h3>
              <p>Just two months after Ford’s announcement that they would sell the Jaguar team, Red Bull completed a deal to acquire the British team’s entry, safeguarding over 340 jobs at the team’s Milton Keynes base.</p>

                <p>Red Bull’s 16 seasons so far in Formula 1 have brought more colour and drama to the sport than anyone could have imagined, and their prestigious junior academy has produced some of the biggest talents on the grid today.
                
                Mercedes are the only team to have eclipsed Red Bull’s achievements since their 2005 debut, and with 64 wins and eight titles (four each in the drivers and constructors’ championships), they’ve firmly cemented their place amongst F1’s most successful ever teams.</p>
